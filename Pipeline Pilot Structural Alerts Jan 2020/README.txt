README

These files were developed for the prediction of human molecular initiating events (MIEs) using structural alerts in Pipeline Pilot.

This location inclues the training and test data used for the AR and GR, and the alerts generated with both the Screen and RE constraints.

These files form part of the supporting information for "In Silico Guidance for In Vitro Androgen and Glucocorticoid Receptor ToxCast Assays" by TEH Allen et al. which can be found at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c01105
