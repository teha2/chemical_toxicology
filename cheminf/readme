These files will help you build a predictive model in Colab.

Chemical receptor binding iput data is included for the Androgen receptor (AR, ).

Codes are included to link a Colab Notebook to your Google Drive (mount_drive.ipynb) and to construct as predictive model for the provided input data (model_construction.ipynb).

First, copy the AR_input.csv file into your Google Drive

Then open a Colab Notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true, choose "New Python 3 Notebook").

Open a new code cell and copy in the mount_drive.ipynb code, then run it (press the play button on the left. Follow the instructions to connect your Google Drive to this Colab Notebook.
