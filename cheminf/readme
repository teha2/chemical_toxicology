These files will help you build a predictive model in Colab.

Chemical receptor binding iput data is included for the Androgen receptor (AR, AR_input.csv).

Codes are included to link a Colab Notebook to your Google Drive (mount_drive.py) and to construct as predictive model for the provided input data (model_construction.py).

First, copy the AR_input.csv file into your Google Drive.

Then open a Colab Notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true, choose "New Python 3 Notebook").

Open a new code cell and copy in the mount_drive.py code, then run it (press the play button on the left. Follow the instructions to connect your Google Drive to this Colab Notebook.

Then, open another new cell and copy in the model_construction.py code. Running this code will allow you to construct your first model!

To improve the model you will need to change the hyperparameters for training.
