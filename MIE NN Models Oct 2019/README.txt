README

These files were developed in 2018 and 2019 for the prediction of human molecular initiating events (MIEs) using neural networks.

Python codes are included to generate moleuclar fingerprints, build models and recall those models.

Models devloped in TensorFlow during the research (1) and improved models optimized in keras (2) are included.

Input biological data used in model construction is also included for reference, and one (AR) has already been converted into a moleuclar fingerprint.

Further information on the models is available in the included PDF.
