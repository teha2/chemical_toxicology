README

These files were developed in 2019 and 2020 for generating confidence in active and inactive predictions using structral alerts.

Pipeline Pilot workflows are included for structural alert generation, SMILES to SMARTS fragment conversion and structural alert predictions with confidence.

Training, test and validation datasets and lists of structural alerts in SMARTS are also included.
