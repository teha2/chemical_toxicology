README

These files were developed in 2019 and 2020 for the prediction of human molecular initiating events (MIEs) using neural networks.

Python codes are included to generate moleuclar fingerprints, generate chemical clusters, build models and recall those models.

Finalised models are included that were developed on the "Comparison Data/Training" datasets for evaluation on the "Comparison Data/Test" datasets.

Input biological data used in model construction is included for reference as raw files, files divided as training and test for comparison to other models, and clustered files used in clustered cross-validation.

Further information on the models is available in the included PDF.
